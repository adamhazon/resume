# Resume

This project was created to present a nice Frontend structure for a basic application. Everything is mobile friendly, check it out!

You can click on any list item and move to the details page. You can add, edit and delete item and I'll add more features in the future.

It shows basic API functions. No backend or database at the moment, all changes happens in the store. (so don't be afraid to make changes - it will come back on refresh)

It was built using Angular-cli, NgRx & Angular Material.

It's just the beginning and I plan to continue with this project.
You can see it live and play with it on `http://adamhazon.com`.

### Development server

- Run `npm install`

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Enjoy :smile:
